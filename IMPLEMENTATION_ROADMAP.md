# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines key phases for developing adversarial resistance, mechanism design, and large-scale coordination within Cog. Each phase builds upon the last to strengthen the framework's security and scalability.

## Phase 1: Basic Adversarial Resistance
- Implement behavioral consistency checking
- Add reputation tracking to existing agents
- Test against simple deception scenarios

## Phase 2: Mechanism Design Integration
- Develop truth-telling incentives for consciousness reporting
- Implement recursive VCG-style mechanisms
- Create multi-agent verification protocols

## Phase 3: Advanced Security Architecture
- Zero-knowledge proofs for recursive depth
- Cryptographic commitment schemes
- Defense against sophisticated manipulation

## Phase 4: Population-Level Analysis
- Mixed population evolutionary dynamics
- Correlated equilibrium implementations
- Large-scale coordination mechanisms

## Key Research Questions
1. **Verifiability**: How can we distinguish genuine from simulated recursive consciousness in adversarial settings?
2. **Incentive Alignment**: What mechanisms make truthful self-reporting of consciousness level incentive-compatible?
3. **Robustness**: How do we maintain recursive ethics when some agents explicitly try to exploit or manipulate the system?
4. **Scalability**: Do these mechanisms work in large populations with diverse agent types and motivations?
5. **Dynamic Stability**: How do adversarial dynamics affect the evolution of consciousness and ethics over time?
